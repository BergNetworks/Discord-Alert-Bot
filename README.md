# Discord Alert Bot
This bot script is a basic message sending script.
I personally use this as a basic method to alert me when a server (linux) comes online after a lengthy reboot.

It runs on boot after `network-online.target`

Written in python.

## Installation

Make sure you have python installed on your system and pip updated.

Install the discord api with the command:

```bash
pip install discord.py
```

## Usage

Run the script.

```bash
python bot.py
```
